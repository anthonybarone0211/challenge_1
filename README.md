## Part 1 - 
used the len() function to count the number of elements in the list.

set that length equal to **number_of_loans**

printed some extra print lines to organize the output.
than printed a title **part 1**
than printed the **number_of_loans**
used the sum() function to total all the numbers in the list and added it a variable **total_sum_of_loans**

created an **avg_loan_amount** variable that divided the **total_sum_of_loans** by the **number_of_loans**

## Part 2

Used the **.get** method to call the Key in the list to pull the **future value** and the **remaining months**

addeded them each to their own variable and printed the results

used those variables to help calculate **present_value**
printed the results

utilized an **if statement** to compare **present_value** to the **loan_price** by pulling value with a **.get** method.
printed the results.


## Part 3

defined a new function **calculate_present_value**
this allows us to call the function throughout the code without having to retype the formula.
have it return **present_value**

ran a for loop to filter through the loans and add the **loan_price** of each loan only if it was less than or equal to 500. Added it to the list by using the .append method.
